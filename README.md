# Machine-Learning-for-Credit-Prediction
This analysis demonstrates how psychometric data can be used to create a reliable credit score for people with a limited credit history (thin-file applicants). We also compare simple models like logistic regression with advanced ML techniques to showcase how these methods capture complex relationships and improve predictive power.

## Important notes

- This analysis uses **real Dynamic Risk Assessment data**
- DRA variables have been generalized or renamed in this public version
- **All financial data** (accounts, arrears, age on book, bad outcome) is simulated 
- No real candidate or client information is included
- Minor differences in model performance compared to the original analysis are expected due to simulation noise
